### Problem 1

In the data cleaning code below we create a `city_state` variable, change `victim_age` to numeric, modifiy victim_race to have categories white and non-white, with white as the reference category, and create a `resolution` variable indicating whether the homicide is solved. Lastly, we filtered out the following cities: Tulsa, AL; Dallas, TX; Phoenix, AZ; and Kansas City, MO; and we retained only the variables `city_state`, `resolution`, `victim_age`, `victim_sex`, and `victim_race`.

```{r q1_data_cleaning}


homicide_df = 
  read_csv("data/homicide-data.csv", na = c("", "NA", "Unknown")) |> 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "),
    victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age),
    resolution = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ 0,
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ 0,
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ 1)
  ) |> 
  filter(victim_race %in% c("White", "Black")) |> 
  filter(!(city_state %in% c("Tulsa, AL", "Dallas, TX", "Phoenix, AZ", "Kansas City, MO"))) |> 
  select(city_state, resolution, victim_age, victim_sex, victim_race)
```

Next we fit a logistic regression model using only data from Baltimore, MD. We model `resolved` as the outcome and `victim_age`, `victim_sex`, and `victim_race` as predictors. We save the output as `baltimore_glm` so that we can apply `broom::tidy` to this object and obtain the estimate and confidence interval of the adjusted odds ratio for solving homicides comparing non-white victims to white victims.

```{r q1_glm_baltimore}
baltimore_glm = 
  filter(homicide_df, city_state == "Baltimore, MD") |> 
  glm(resolution ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, family = binomial(), data = _)

baltimore_glm |> 
  broom::tidy() |> 
  mutate(
    OR = exp(estimate), 
    OR_CI_upper = exp(estimate + 1.96 * std.error),
    OR_CI_lower = exp(estimate - 1.96 * std.error)) |> 
  filter(term == "victim_sexMale") |> 
  select(OR, OR_CI_lower, OR_CI_upper) |>
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

Below, by incorporating `nest()`, `map()`, and `unnest()` into the preceding Baltimore-specific code, we fit a model for each of the cities, and extract the adjusted odds ratio (and CI) for solving homicides comparing non-white victims to white victims. We show the first 5 rows of the resulting dataframe of model results.

```{r q1_glm_all_cities}
model_results = 
  homicide_df |> 
  nest(data = -city_state) |> 
  mutate(
    models = map(data, \(df) glm(resolution ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, 
                             family = binomial(), data = df)),
    tidy_models = map(models, broom::tidy)) |> 
  select(-models, -data) |> 
  unnest(cols = tidy_models) |> 
  mutate(
    OR = exp(estimate), 
    OR_CI_upper = exp(estimate + 1.96 * std.error),
    OR_CI_lower = exp(estimate - 1.96 * std.error)) |> 
  filter(term == "victim_sexMale") |> 
  select(city_state, OR, OR_CI_lower, OR_CI_upper)


model_results |>
  slice(1:5) |> 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

Below we generate a plot of the estimated ORs and CIs for each city, ordered by magnitude of the OR from smallest to largest. From this plot we see that most cities have odds ratios that are smaller than 1, suggesting that crimes with male victims have smaller odds of resolution compared to crimes with female victims after adjusting for victim age and race. This disparity is strongest in New yrok. In roughly half of these cities, confidence intervals are narrow and do not contain 1, suggesting a significant difference in resolution rates by sex after adjustment for victim age and race. 

```{r q1_plot}
model_results |> 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, OR)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = OR)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = OR_CI_lower, ymax = OR_CI_upper)) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```

# Problem 2

## load data
```{r q2_data_cleaning}

weather_df = 
  rnoaa::meteo_pull_monitors(
    c("USW00094728"),
    var = c("PRCP", "TMIN", "TMAX"), 
    date_min = "2022-01-01",
    date_max = "2022-12-31") |>
  mutate(
    name = recode(id, USW00094728 = "CentralPark_NY"),
    tmin = tmin / 10,
    tmax = tmax / 10) |>
  select(name, id, everything())


```

## create 5000 bootstrap samples

```{r bootstrap}

boot_sample = function(df) {
  sample_frac(df, replace = TRUE)
}

weather_boot_straps = 
  tibble(strap_number = 1:5000) |> 
  mutate(
    strap_sample = map(strap_number, \(i) boot_sample(df = weather_df))
  )

boot_straps = 
  tibble(strap_number = 1:5) |> 
  mutate(
    strap_sample = map(strap_number, \(i) boot_sample(df = weather_df))
  )

```

## quick check
```{r quick_check, include=FALSE}
weather_boot_straps |> 
  slice(1:3) |> 
  mutate(strap_sample = map(strap_sample, arrange, tmin)) |> 
  pull(strap_sample)
```

## get estimates

```{r estimates}
bootstrap_results = 
  weather_boot_straps |> 
  mutate(
    models = map(strap_sample, \(df) lm(tmax ~ tmin + prcp, data = df)),
    tidy = map(models, broom::tidy),
    glance = map(models, broom::glance))|> 
  select(-strap_sample, -models) |> 
  unnest(c(tidy,glance), names_repair = "universal") |> 
  select(strap_number,term,r.squared,estimate) |>
  filter(term !="(Intercept)") |>
  group_by(strap_number) |>
        pivot_wider(
    names_from = term,
    values_from = estimate) |>
  mutate(log = log(tmin*prcp)) |>
  select(-tmin,-prcp) |>
  janitor::clean_names()
  



a =
  boot_straps |> 
  mutate(
    models = map(strap_sample, \(df) lm(tmax ~ tmin + prcp, data = df)),
    tidy = map(models, broom::tidy),
    glance = map(models, broom::glance))|> 
  select(-strap_sample, -models) |> 
  unnest(c(tidy,glance), names_repair = "universal") |> 
  select(strap_number,term,r.squared,estimate) |>
  filter(term !="(Intercept)") |>
  group_by(strap_number) |>
        pivot_wider(
    names_from = term,
    values_from = estimate)
```

## plot the distribution

```{r plot}

r2_dist = bootstrap_results |>
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = r_squared), color = "blue") 
r2_dist
ggsave("r2_dist.png")

log_dist = bootstrap_results |>
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = log), color = "red") 
log_dist
ggsave("log_dist.png")
```

Description for the plots:

* r2_dist: the r2 for the 5000 bootstrap samples are approximately normally distributed.The mean or mode of r2 falls around 9.1 and the variance is not large(most of data locates between 0.87 and 0.95). These suggests that a high proportion of variance in the `tmax`  can be explained by `tmin` and `prcp` included in the model.The relatively tight clustering of r2 values also suggests that the underlying data are likely to be of high quality with strong linear relationships.


* log_dist: through log transformation, 3288 data (beta1*beta2<0) was excluded; meanwhile, because beta1Xbeta2 is too small(positive), log transformation reduced skewness and made the distribution of this product more symmetrical. But the overall distribution is still left skewed. most of the data falls around -6.These indicates that for more than 3288 samples, `tmin` and `prcp` have opposite effects on `tmax`; for 1822 samples, `tmin` and `prcp` have effects on `tmax`in the same direction. Absolute of beta2 tend to be very small. 



## identify the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles to provide a 95% confidence interval 

```{r}
# r2

# get quantiles
quantiles = round(quantile(pull(bootstrap_results,r_squared), probs = c(0.025, 0.975)),2)

# identify the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles
lower_bound <- quantiles[1]  # 2.5% quantile
upper_bound <- quantiles[2]  # 97.5% quantile

# paste them to create the 95% Confidence Interval
cat("95% Confidence Interval for r2: [", lower_bound, ", ", upper_bound, "]", sep="")

# log(b1*b2)

# get quantiles
quantiles2 = round(quantile(pull(bootstrap_results,log), probs = c(0.025, 0.975), na.rm= TRUE),2)

# identify the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles
lower_bound2 <- quantiles[1]  # 2.5% quantile
upper_bound2 <- quantiles[2]  # 97.5% quantile

# paste them to create the 95% Confidence Interval
cat("95% Confidence Interval for r2: [", lower_bound2, ", ", upper_bound2, "]", sep="")
```
